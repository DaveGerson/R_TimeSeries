Demo of Time Series forecasting with Differencing

This file utilizes the ts package to perform an ARIMA model on new car sales data.  This data has unique features to it, particularly very clear annual seasonality and has an unseasonal 1,1,1 model.  

Exploration in this data set was done to determine what the current model looks like as well as to explore what that model would have behaved like for the 2008 crash.  

Future plans involve a decision point , forecasting replenishment, for a time period in the future.  This would use the anticipated residual to provide a guideline based on optimal profit with minimal risk.
